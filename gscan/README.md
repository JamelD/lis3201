### Group Environmental Scan

#### Objectives 
Environmental Scan is a synthesized statement to summarize previous research studies or background of your problem. Previously, every group was asked to develop the structure (2-4 subsections) of your Environmental Scan. And in your Individual Environmental Scan assignment, everyone in your team came up with some syntheses to address one chosen subsection.

#### Tasks
Now, we will use your chosen structure (2-4 subsections) and everyone's syntheses to compose your Group Environmental Scan. Here are step-by-step guideline for you to develop this:

- Step 1: Check out your feedback for your Individual Environmental Scans, see if you have come up with good synthesized statements instead of relevancy statements or article summaries. If not, seek the following instructions for possible improvements.
    + Synthesized statements are used to objectively report key findings that are relevant to your chosen subsection, and organize them in a logical structure. The purpose is to help your readers to understand your subsection. Here is a typical structure:
        * Topic sentence to elaborate your chosen subsection
            - Finding I about the subsection
                + Detailed statistics or elaborations from source I 
                + Detailed statistics or elaborations from source II
            - Finding II about the subsection
                + Detailed statistics or elaborations from source I 
                + Detailed statistics or elaborations from source II
    + Examples of Synthesized Statement, Relevancy Evaluation, and Article Summaries:
        * Synthesized statement:
            Social media is found to have negative impacts on mental health. According to McGrath (2019)’s survey study, 80% of survey participants who are older than 16 agreed that social media negatively impacted their mental health. To reduce the negative impact, Instagram hid the number of likes on their posts for certain countries (McGrath, 2019).
        * Relevancy evaluation:
            I think the article of McGrath (2019) can serve as a backbone of my argument that social media has negative impacts on people’s mental health, because he said Instagram hid likes function in one country due to the negative mental impacts that have been found.
        * Article summaries:
            The article of McGrath (2019) talks about how social media can have negative impacts on people’s mental health. In his survey, he found that 80% of survey participants who are older than 16 agreed that social media negatively impacted their mental health. As a response, Instagram hid likes function in one country due to the negative mental impacts that have been found. 
- Step 2: Check out the comments of your previous assignment, and see if you understand how to use in-text citations in APA format in your synthesized statement. Every time you refer to findings from your sources, you need use in-text citations to give authors the credit. Post to the APA Discussion Board if you have any questions.
- Step 3: Put everyone's edited syntheses together according to subsections in a single document:
    + Subsection I
        * Team member A's synthesis
        * Team member B's synthesis
    + Subsection II
        * Team member C's synthesis
        * Team member D's synthesis
    + ...
- Step 4: Add transition sentences, add topic sentences, change inconsistent wordings, etc. to make your logic flow for each subsection as smooth as possible. Make it seem as if one person wrote the entire Environmental Scan.
- Step 5: Add an intro paragraph and a conclusion paragraph to your literature review
    + Intro para: one paragraph briefly introduces
        * the context of your topic, e.g., Millennials heavily depend on social media in their daily life, which might impact their mental health and social life qualities.
        * the scope of your environmental scan, e.g., in our environmental scan, we will review the positive and negative impacts of social media on mental health and social life from previous studies, especially for millennials. 
    + Conclusion para: one paragraph concluding
        * Key points of your environmental scan, e.g., although millennials are found are heavy social media users, the impacts on mental health and social life are complex. Both positive and negative impacts are found for this group.  
        * Contribution or significance of your study, e.g., although previous studies found some impacts for millennials, there is no study researching on FSU millennials, which will be the focus of our proposed study.
