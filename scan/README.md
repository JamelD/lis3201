### Environmental Scan

#### Objectives 
You will create an environmental scan. To do this, you will select important publications on the chosen topic and synthesize the content. This is an opportunity to build your skills of searching, reading, reviewing the sources, and synthesizing the contents for the environmental scan section in your final research paper. At a later date, all of the individual submissions will be combined for the group submission.

#### Tasks
- Review your subsections that you were assigned by the group.
- Use at least two articles that are academic/professional and peer-reviewed journal or conference articles. IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT PLEASE ASK! You are welcome to use additional resources as necessary but must have at least two peer-reviewed articles. 
- Write an introduction to your chosen problem and introduce the subsection you are working on. Use a third source to emphasize how your subsection relates to your overall topic.
- Make sure all of your sources are in Zotero. If they are not, they will not be counted.
- Write a synthesized statement minimum of 300 words, including cohesive findings/story from your two chosen articles (Try to find "the themes" that can be used to address your problem or sub-sections in your literature. It's usually a combo of theme/finding and back-up in-text citation.)
- Write a brief conclusion to your environmental scan.
- Submit your writing to Turnitin before submitting it to Canvas. It is a required step to avoid plagiarism. Make changes if necessary.
- Review your references and in-text citations for APA 7th style.
- Review your writing and make sure it is proofread.
